#+TITLE: Building with private modules

Here I'll test setting up a Go project that can optionally include a private module.

* Questions to answer
** Can this package be built and used without the private module?
** Can this package be built *with* the private module?
** Is it easy to switch between the two?
** How hard is it to leak details from the private module into this one?
